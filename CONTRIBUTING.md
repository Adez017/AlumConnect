## üîß How to Contribute

This project follows the standard GitHub [fork and pull request workflow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/contributing-to-projects).

1.  **Fork the repository**
    Click on the \`Fork\` button at the top right of this repo: `https://github.com/<your-username>/SIH2024.git`

2.  **Clone your fork locally**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/](https://github.com/)<your-username>/SIH2024.git
    cd SIH2024
    ```

3.  **Create a new branch**
    Always create a new branch for your work. Use a descriptive name (e.g., `fix/login-bug`, `feature/dark-mode`).
    ```bash
    git checkout -b feature/YourFeatureName
    ```

4.  **Make your changes**
    * Follow clean code practices.
    * Ensure your code is well-documented (e.g., in-code comments, updated READMEs).
    * Run tests before committing (if applicable) to ensure nothing is broken.

5.  **Commit your changes**
    Use meaningful and concise commit messages.
    ```bash
    git commit -m "Added: <short description of your change>"
    ```

6.  **Push to your fork**
    ```bash
    git push origin feature/YourFeatureName
    ```

7.  **Create a Pull Request (PR)**
    * Go to the original repository.
    * Click on **New Pull Request**.
    * Ensure the base branch is correct (usually `main` or `master` of the original repo) and the compare branch is your new feature branch.
    * Provide a clear and detailed description of your changes, including:
        * What problem does this PR solve?
        * How was it tested?
        * Any relevant issue numbers (e.g., "Closes #123").

## ‚úÖ Contribution Rules

To keep the repository clean and maintainable, please adhere to these rules:

* **Commit Messages:** Use meaningful commit messages that clearly describe the change.
* **Folder Structure:** Stick to the existing folder structure. Do not move files unnecessarily.
* **File Size:** Avoid committing unnecessary large files (e.g., `node_modules`, `build` artifacts).
* **PR Scope:** Keep PRs focused and small (don‚Äôt bundle unrelated changes). A PR should ideally address a single bug or feature.

---

## üí° Suggestions

* **Propose Features:** Want to propose a new feature? Open a **discussion or issue** first before starting work to ensure it aligns with the project's direction.
* **Code Reviews:** Be respectful and collaborative in code reviews. Constructive criticism helps everyone grow.
